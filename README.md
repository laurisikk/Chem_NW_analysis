Network analysis of publication data for institute of chemistry, university of tartu

Publication data and list of workers taken from etis.ee (might be interesting to use beautiful soup and google scholar instead).
Each node is person, each connection is co-authored publication. Clusters in network correlate very well with the structure
of institute (with some exeptional persons). Some of the nodes can be faulty as women can have different last names at different
time points (some attempts were made to look for potential duplicate nodes/names).
